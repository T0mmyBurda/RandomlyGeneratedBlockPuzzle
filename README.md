# RandomlyGeneratedBlockPuzzle
This repo will contain code that will randomly generate a disassembled block puzzle meant to be 3d printed

This Repo is a working process my plan is:

1. a 2D demo of how the puzzle will be generated in a matrix

2. convert that 2D demo to a 3D demo using a three dimensional array

3. make python script run in Blender and generate blocks based off of 2D array

4. make additonal code to optimize blocks for 3D printing (size, overhang ect.)
